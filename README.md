You might want to create a local_settings.py file under the mossweb folder do personalize your installation. Some things you are likely to set:

```
SECRET_KEY = 'somegoodandsecretkey'
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['yourhostname']
MOSS_USERID = 12345
UPLOADS_ROOT = '/your/upload/folder'
HTTP_PREFIX = 'mossweb/' # In case you are using a reverse proxy
STATIC_URL = '/mossweb/static/' # In case you set the HTTP_PREFIX
```

```
python manage.py migrate
```

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

```
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Point your web browser to http://yourhost:8000/ and you should see the front page of the app. Use the Django admin module at http://yourhost:8000/admin to create courses and assignments.
